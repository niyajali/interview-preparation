# Kotlin

### What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is fully interoperable with Java. Developed by JetBrains, it is designed to improve upon Java by providing more concise syntax and enhanced features such as null safety, extension functions, and data classes. Kotlin is used for various applications, but it has gained significant popularity in Android app development, making it a preferred choice for many developers in the mobile development community.
