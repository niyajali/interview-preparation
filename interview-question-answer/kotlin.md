# Kotlin

### What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is fully interoperable with Java. Developed by JetBrains, it is designed to improve upon Java by providing more concise syntax and enhanced features such as null safety, extension functions, and data classes. Kotlin is used for various applications, but it has gained significant popularity in Android app development, making it a preferred choice for many developers in the mobile development community.

### What is Kotlin Multiplatform?

Kotlin Multiplatform is a feature of Kotlin that allows developers to write code that can run on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web, and desktop. By leveraging shared code across platforms, developers can reduce duplication and streamline maintenance, while still accessing platform-specific libraries and features when necessary. Kotlin Multiplatform achieves this by allowing the common logic to be written in Kotlin, and then tailored platform-specific code can be added as needed. This approach enables a more efficient development process for cross-platform applications.
